# Cingulata

Cingulata (pronounced "tchingulata") is a compiler toolchain and RTE for running C++ programs over encrypted data by means of fully homomorphic encryption techniques.

The toolchain is formerly known as the Armadillo toolchain.

The open source version of the toolchain will be released in the first weeks of 2018 (itâ€™s a hard commitment :-).

In the meantime, you may want to look at some of our group publications which talk about the toolchain and what we have been able to achieve with it. Most notably,
